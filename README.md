Day 1

Mock Up Views

Draw the screens that the user will see when accessing the client. This does not have to be too complicated - just enough to have an idea of what you are going to be coding. A common practice is to draw the "first use" flow: What happens when a user loads your page for the first time?

Mock Data Flow

Decide the shape of your data and where it needs to be in your application. Do you need to pass props? Draw it out. Do you need to inject a function? Draw it out.

This is also when you should set up your schema (decide on your entities - add required fields - figure out the types of relationships - setup your join tables and foreign keys). Spin up your database and populate your schema.

Create Express Endpoints

Now that you know what your data looks like and where it should go you can start creating your Express server and end points. Do one at a time, while checking each endpoint's response in Postman.

Day 2

Create Client Pages

Create your client views using mocked data to simulate a call to your api. Once the views are in place and working you can move on to...

Connect Client to Express

Connecting your client to your api, replacing mocked data with actual data from your express api. You can use jQuery to perform your calls to the server, but now would be a good time to explore the built-in Fetch feature (unless you are using Angular in which case you should stick with $http)

Day 3

Feature Iteration

Rinse and repeat for each feature you want to include. If you are feature complete at this point consider writing some unit tests.

Day 4

Style

Time to finish up the styling of the application. Take the current look of the application and think about what would make it more pleasing to the end user. UI and UX are very important aspects of being a web developer.

Deploy

Now that your application looks and works like you expect it to it's time to show it off. Deploy your application for the world to see.

Day 5

Finish Up

Clean up any remaining issues and think about how you can present your app in 1-2 minutes for your new juniors.

But also, get some rest!
